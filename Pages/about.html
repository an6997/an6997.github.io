        <p class="grid"><strong>Hi! I'm Amy, a lover of adventure and learning new things.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        I just graduated from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry
        and Molecular Biology. During my three years at UC Davis, I was an undergraduate research assistant at the
        Yiu Lab and also spent some time as a Research Associate in the Emergency Department of the UC Davis Medical
        Center.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am back home in the South Bay Area, California, looking for a job as a medical scribe or research
        technician while I apply to medical school.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I'm not busy with work or school, you can find me sweating it out at the gym, learning how
        to take pictures, or crafting whatever my heart desires. Check out my other pages if you want
        to learn more about me!</p>
